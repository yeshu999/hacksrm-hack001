The idea is to create a database that stores all details of patients like personal details, physical attributes, allergies, disabilities, past health issues, current medication. 
All this data can be accessed using a website with login id as Adharnumber  and passcode as Date of birth. So any doctor can access this data.

Some misc. features

1. The website will allow the doctors and the user to access all his medical data in one place without having to search through different files and hospital records, all in one centralised location. this will save a lot of hassle and time

2. The website will have an emergency button which will disclose only a certain ammount of data that is required in case there's an accident like blood group, allergies, past medication. 

3. There will also be a database of all the bloodbanks and organ donation bank, so whenever the emergency button is pressed, the doctor can send a request to get the blood type from the nearest blood bank and same can be done with organs.

4. There is a seperate tab for current medication, that'll have all the medications that the patient is under currently. the doctor, instead of writing prescription can simply add medicines to this list. Then patient will then have a complete list of all the medication that he is under.

5. A prescription does not just consist of names of medicines but also the time that those medications should be consumed. so the doctor can also enter that and then using website notifications, patients can be reminded to take medicines.

6. Also with one click, the patient can buy all the medicines from the online stores.
